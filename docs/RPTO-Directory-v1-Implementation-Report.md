# RPTO Directory Feature Implementation Report

## Implemented Features

1.  **Data Management:**
    *   `src/data/rptos.ts`: A local TypeScript file serves as the single source of truth for RPTO data.
    *   **100 Mock RPTO Entries:** Generated and integrated into `src/data/rptos.ts`, distributed across all Indian state and UT capitals, ensuring a robust dataset for testing and demonstration.
    *   **Zod Schema Validation:** RPTO data is validated using Zod, ensuring type safety and data integrity.

2.  **Core Components:**
    *   **`RptoFilter` (`src/features/rpto/components/RptoFilter.tsx`):**
        *   Implemented with search input and city dropdown.
        *   Utilizes Radix UI for accessible and customizable select component.
        *   Styled with Tailwind CSS.
        *   Integrates `lucide-react` for the search icon.
        *   Provides filtering logic for RPTOs based on search term and city selection.
    *   **`RptoList` (`src/features/rpto/components/RptoList.tsx`):**
        *   Displays a grid of `RptoCard` components.
        *   Handles the display of a "No RPTOs Found" message when the filtered list is empty.
        *   Styled with Tailwind CSS for responsive grid layout.
    *   **`RptoCard` (`src/features/rpto/components/RptoCard.tsx`):**
        *   Displays essential RPTO information: logo, name, and city.
        *   Links to the individual RPTO detail page (`/rpto/[id]`).
        *   Styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean, card-like presentation.
        *   **RPTO Logo Integration:** The logo image is now correctly displayed.
    *   **`RptoDetailPage` (`src/app/[locale]/rpto/[id]/page.tsx`):**
        *   Dynamic Next.js route to display detailed information for a single RPTO.
        *   Fetches RPTO data based on the `id` from `rptos.ts`.
        *   Displays RPTO name, address, website (with external link icon from `lucide-react`), description.
        *   Integrates `CourseCard` for each course offered by the RPTO.
        *   Integrates `RequestInfoForm` for user inquiries.
        *   Handles `notFound()` for invalid RPTO IDs.
    *   **`CourseCard` (`src/features/rpto/components/CourseCard.tsx`):**
        *   Displays course details: name, duration, and description.
        *   Styled with Tailwind CSS.
    *   **`RequestInfoForm` (`src/features/rpto/components/RequestInfoForm.tsx`):**
        *   Implemented using `react-hook-form` for robust form management.
        *   Form fields (Name, Email, Message) are validated using Zod schema.
        *   Submits inquiries via a `mailto:` link, pre-populating the recipient, subject, and body with form data.
        *   Includes basic input fields and a textarea, styled with Tailwind CSS.
        *   Displays validation error messages.

3.  **Integration & Utilities:**
    *   **`RptoDirectoryPage` (`src/app/[locale]/rpto/page.tsx`):**
        *   Serves as the main entry point for the RPTO directory.
        *   Manages filter state and applies filtering logic to the `rptos` data.
        *   Passes filtered data to `RptoList` and unique cities to `RptoFilter`.
        *   Uses `useMemo` for performance optimization of filtering and unique city generation.
    *   **`cn` utility (`src/utils/cn.ts`):** Used consistently across components for merging Tailwind CSS classes.

## Avoided Scope (as per initial plan and user instructions)

1.  **Backend API Integration for RPTO Data:** The RPTO data is currently managed locally in `src/data/rptos.ts` and validated with Zod. No external API calls are made for fetching RPTO information. This aligns with the initial scope to keep the feature self-contained for v1.
2.  **Complex Authentication/Authorization:** The feature does not involve any specific authentication or authorization logic beyond what might be provided by Clerk for the overall application. Access to RPTO details is public.
3.  **Database Persistence for RPTO Data:** RPTO data is static and not stored in a database for this version.
4.  **Advanced Search Functionality:** The search is a simple case-insensitive substring match on the RPTO name. No fuzzy searching, full-text indexing, or complex query building has been implemented.
5.  **Server-Side Form Submission:** The `RequestInfoForm` uses a `mailto:` link for submission, avoiding the need for a backend API endpoint to handle form data.
6.  **Custom CSS:** All styling is done using Tailwind CSS, adhering to the rule of avoiding custom CSS files.
7.  **External Dependencies (beyond specified):** The implementation strictly adheres to the specified technologies (Radix UI, Tailwind, react-hook-form, Zod, lucide-react) and avoids introducing new, unspecified external libraries.

## Technical Debt

1.  **Storybook Stories:** While the scaffolding for Storybook is in place, detailed stories for each component (`RptoFilter`, `RptoList`, `RptoCard`, `RptoDetailPage`, `CourseCard`, `RequestInfoForm`) need to be fully developed to cover various states, props, and interactions.
2.  **Vitest Tests:** Comprehensive unit and integration tests using Vitest (with `@testing-library/react`) are required for all components to ensure their correct functionality, edge case handling, and prevent regressions.
3.  **Internationalization (i18n):**
    *   While the `next-intl` setup is present, the user-facing strings within the RPTO Directory components (e.g., "Search by name...", "No RPTOs Found", "Your Name", "Send Inquiry", "About", "Courses Offered") are currently hardcoded in English. These need to be moved to locale JSON files (`src/locales/en.json`, `src/locales/or.json`, etc.) and integrated using `useTranslations` or `getTranslations` to support multiple languages, including Odia.
    *   The `RptoDirectoryPage` title and description are also hardcoded.
4.  **Accessibility (beyond Radix UI):** While Radix UI provides a strong foundation for accessibility, a thorough audit of the entire RPTO Directory UI for ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and focus management is recommended to ensure full compliance.
5.  **Performance Optimization:** While `useMemo` is used, further performance profiling (e.g., with React DevTools) could identify areas for optimization, especially with larger datasets or more complex filtering.
6.  **Error Handling/User Feedback:** Beyond Zod validation errors in the form, there isn't extensive user feedback for other potential issues (e.g., network errors if an API were to be introduced later, or more graceful handling of missing images beyond `object-contain`).
7.  **Image Optimization:** While `next/image` is used, ensuring proper image sizes, formats (e.g., WebP), and CDN usage for the RPTO logos (if they were to be served from a remote source) would be a future optimization.
