description: Defines the complete requirements and technical design for a feature. This phase is the most critical for preventing feature creep.
---

Context: The goal is to produce a detailed, unambiguous plan that the development team can execute without needing to make scope-related decisions. All work must adhere to the [As our Framework or Codebased].

OUTPUT : Produce 2 docs with appropriate file naming:
<Final Proposal Project managment>.md
<Final Proposed design and Engineering Doc>.md

Steps:

WF-201: Define Feature Scope: Create a detailed feature specification document outlining user stories and explicit acceptance criteria. Crucially, define what is out of scope.
WF-202: Technical Design:
Create a technical blueprint based on the approved scope.
Identify all new components, API routes, and database schema changes.
Consult the [memory and relevant rulesbooks established in .windsurf] for correct architecture.
WF-203: Management & Communication:
Estimate the effort and set a timeline.
Communicate the plan to all stakeholders.
WF-204: Scope Lock-in (Gateway):
Action: Formal review and approval of the complete plan by the project lead.
Rule: No further scope changes or requirements will be accepted after this point. Any new ideas must be logged for a future development cycle.
Output Artifact: "Approved Feature Blueprint".
